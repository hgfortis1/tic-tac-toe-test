How to improve this test?
1. Give an outline about what would be required prior to test? e.g. Is it a Web Application/ Web Service?
2. Specific Details about how tic-tac-toe is played would be nice, rules etc.. For example, Do i choose "X" or "O" for each play or its automatic that once i click "X" then the next player move is "O"
3. I may have spent too much time thinking about how to do this one. Reason for this, I could have done a very simple ASP.NET app using session variable within the ASP.NET Application to store moves. 

How to improve otherwise?
1. Instead of Sessions, i would store data in a database
